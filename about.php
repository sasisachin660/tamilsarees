            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>Established by Mr. Jeyachandran, a textile technocrat with more than three decades of experience in the textile field, in the early 1980s, Ramachandran Textiles is a flourishing textile enterprise based at the heart of Trivandrum City.</p>
            <p>After the whooping success of Ramachandran Textiles in Trivandrum, Kerala, Mr. Jeyachandran considered business expansion and hence Jeyachandran Textiles. Originally started in 1998 in a single building at No. 27, Ranganathan Street, Chennai, it now occupies five independent buildings in Ranganathan Street, and one in Usman Road, near Panagal Park, Chennai and has also opened a brand new showroom in Pallikaranai recently.</p>
            <p>With separate outlets for Gents, Ladies, Kids, Electronic appliances, Furniture spread across the crowded street and also well-known as the busiest street in Chennai, Jeyachandran Textiles has everything for the kid at your home to the elderlies.</p>
            <p>Apart from catering to the textile needs of our customers, Jeyachandran also has separate outlets for Footwear, Shoes, Bags, and other accessories for Men and Women.</p>
            <p>Later in the year 2000, the group ventured into the jewelry business by opening up Jeyachandran Gold House in the same Ranganathan Street. Other than the offline stores we have also launched <a href="https://www.jeyachandran.com" target="_blank">www.jeyachandran.com</a> with the vision of becoming one of the largest online stores.</p>
            <p>Currently, all the establishments are being ably looked after by the next generation of the family with Mr. Jeyachandran as the sole proprietor.</p>
